    <h2>About Sudan University</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        Sudan University of Science and Technology is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Sudan. 
        It was established in <strong>1902</strong> as the Khartoum Technical School and the School of Commerce, 
        later evolving through several institutions into a modern university. 
        In 1990, it officially became known as Sudan University of Science and Technology.
      </p>

      <h3>Historical Development</h3>
      <p>
        Over the decades, the university expanded to include multiple colleges and institutes: 
        School of Arts (1946), School of Agriculture (1954), and others. In 1975, all these institutes 
        were merged into the Institute of Technological Colleges, eventually forming the modern university.
